### Creating Angular project
For creating new project run the following command `ng new your-app-name`.

If you are working with **Angular 7** you will be asked the following question:
1. Would you like to add Angular routing? (y/N)
1. Which stylesheet format would you like to use?

### Starting the project
To start the project run `ng serve` or it's shorthand syntax `ng s`.

### Creating component
To create component you need to run in the terminal `ng generate component someName` or you can use shorthand syntax `ng g c someName`. Note that you have to stop the application to create component.
