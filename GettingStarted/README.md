# Getting started

## Prerequisites

Make sure Node.js is installed on your system. You can check by running:

```bash
node -v
```

## Using the Node.js REPL

REPL stands for:

- Read – reads user input
- Eval – evaluates the input
- Print – prints the result
- Loop – loops back to read more input

To start the REPL, simply run:

```bash
node
```

We can provide unlimited commands and they will be executed.

## Running a JavaScript file

**Step 1: Create a file**

Create a file named `app.js` with this content:

```js
console.log("Hello from app.js");
```

**Step 2: Run the file**

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
node app.js
```
