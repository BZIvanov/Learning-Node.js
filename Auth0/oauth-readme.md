## Protocol Endpoints

In OAuth we use 2 grant types of endpoints:

- Authorization type - handles users actions

- Token type - it is meant for machines only

Both types must use Transport Layer Security (TLS).

## OAuth Scope

Scope in OAuth is a permission to do something within a protected resource on behalf of the resource owner.
