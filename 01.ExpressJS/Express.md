## Installing MongoDB on Windows

After you install MongoDB create the following folder _C:\data\db_ Without this folder MongoDB will not work.
To start your mongo server go to installation folder _C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.2\bin_ and open the terminal there and run **mongod**

## Installing MongoDB on Ubuntu

1. Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install mongodb
sudo apt-get update
```

2. To start the MongoDB run:

```bash
sudo service mongodb start
mongo
```

3. And to check if everything is ok, in the same terminal where we have our **mongo** running, type:

```bash
show dbs;
```

The expected result is to see names of the databases we have and space in GBs they take.

## Export/Import mongo database

Note: use the normal terminal on the root level, not the mongodb terminal.

1. Export - to export run the following command in the terminal

```bash
mongoexport --db project-one --collection movies --out resultExport.json
```

2. Import - to import run the following command in the terminal

```bash
mongoimport --db project-one --collection movies --file resultExport.json
```

## Code quality

To use ESLint and Prettier install all the dependencies and create config files for both es-lint and prettier.

## Debugging

For debugging use npm module **ndb** which makes debugging using Node.js very easy.

In the package.json for scripts we need to specify, that we will start our app with ndb.

#### Other Hints

- **module** is a single file and **package** is multiple files working together. So package is a combination of multiple modules.

- If we want to read file just once, not on every request, we can put the reading piece of code outside the createServer method, because outside that method the code is read only once.

- projection - this termin in mongoDB refers to selecting only specific fields/columns from our document/row

- runValidators set to true is very important option for PATCH and PUT requests, because without it we can change valid to invalid data

- global error handler, which is a normal middleware is recognized by Express providing 4 instead of 3 parameters, where the first parameter is the error

```javascript
// this is how the global error middleware looks like
next(err, req, res, next) => {
  // some code here
}
```

- if we pass an argument to the next() method the global error handler will be called

```javascript
// next here will go directly to the global error handler
next(somethingHere);

// next here will go the next middleware in our app
next();
```

- when exporting we usually have to use module.exports, but that is when we are reasigning the exported object, because exports is an object. Meaning if we want to export only a string we must use module.exports, but if we want to just attach property on the exports object we can skip module. part. Below is example.

The key thing here is that exports by default is an empty object

```javascript
// here is ok not to use module because we are not reasigning the default exports object. Now our exports object will have an additional field called fruit
exports.fruit = 'apple';

// here we need to use module because we asign completely new array to the exports
module.exports = ['apple', 'kiwi'];
```
